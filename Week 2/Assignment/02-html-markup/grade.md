Overall a solid first page! I have included specific notes in your index.html page.

Your GitHub folder organization needs reworking. A couple things need to be fixed:
- include only the `in-class` and `assignment` files in the repo. No practice files or other unneeded files
- all file and folder names should be lower case with dashes, no spaces
- You should be organizing by type of deliverable, not by week. This is what your file structure should look like:

/mad9013-deliverables/
  /assignments/
    /02-html-markup/
      index.html
  /in-classes/
    /03-buttons/
      index.html
      /css/
        main.css
  /images/
